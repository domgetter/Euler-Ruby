Project Euler Ruby


This Repository is for my Ruby implementations of math problems on http://www.projecteuler.net

Documentation for each Project Euler problem is located inside each respective Ruby file.

The purpose of this repository is both for fun and for learning Ruby.

If you have any questions or comments, please email me at nicklink483@gmail.com

I gladly receive constructive criticism, as I am a beginning Ruby programmer :)
